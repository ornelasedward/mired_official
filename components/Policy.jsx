            <br />
            <p>
              Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity
              to determine you are the same person about whom we have the
              information in our system. These verification efforts require us
              to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with
              information you have previously provided us. For instance,
              depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to
              provide certain information so that we can match the information
              you provide with the information we already have on file, or we
              may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or
              email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use
              other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We will only use personal information provided in your request to
              verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the
              extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information
              from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot
              verify your identity from the information already maintained by
              us, we may request that you provide additional information for the
              purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
              fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally
              provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
